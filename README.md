This isn't just a script; it's a fully automated platform for deploying a high-performance, customizable Windows 11 RDP session directly from GitHub Actions, secured via Tailscale.

## üî• The Ultimate Leap: From v4 to v7

This version represents a quantum leap from its predecessors. We've moved from a rigid script to a dynamic, user-controlled platform.

| Feature             | Old Era (v4 & Below)               | ‚ú® **The Ultimate Era (v7)** ‚ú®          |
| :------------------ | :--------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------- |
| **Connectivity**    | Ngrok (Public, less stable)        | **Tailscale** (Secure, private P2P)      |
| **Customization**   | Static (Required code edits)       | **Fully Dynamic** (Choose theme, apps, wallpaper via UI) |
| **Software**        | Bare OS                            | **Automated Installation** (Steam, OBS, Chrome, etc.) |
| **User Experience** | Plain text logs                    | **Rich UI** (Colored logs & a clean Summary page) |
| **Performance**     | Standard OS                        | **Performance-Tuned** (Debloated, optimized power plan) |

## ‚ú® Core Features

-   üöÄ **Instant Deployment**: Get a powerful Windows environment running in minutes.
-   üîí **Secure & Stable Connectivity**: Powered by Tailscale for a private, peer-to-peer connection. No public IPs, no open ports.
-   üé® **Deep Customization**: Use the `workflow_dispatch` menu to choose your theme, install optional apps, and set a custom wallpaper from any URL.
-   ‚ö° **Performance-Tuned**: Automatically debloats Windows, activates the "Ultimate Performance" power plan, and disables mouse acceleration for maximum responsiveness.
-   üïµÔ∏è **Stealth Mode**: System information is spoofed to help bypass common VM detection mechanisms.
